# Day 2 of gmx programming formation

# A. Difference between C and Python

1. Read [this](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/difference-between-c-and-python#:~:text=C%20is%20a%20general%2Dpurpose,and%20high%2Dlevel%20programming%20language.), a little reminder of yesterday lecture.
2. Read [this](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/). Like the C cheat sheet, this allows you to see the main particularity of this language.
3. Don't forget to use python like this: `python3 foo.py`

# B. Python:

Enough C, you’ve faced too much low level code, now, let’s code with Python.

## I. Beginners
1. *file name*: *gmx_rot13.py* - Write a program that applies the rot13 to the parameter passed then print it.
2. *file name*: *gmx_pyramid.py* - Write a program that prints this pattern only using loop.

        * 
        * * 
        * * * 
        * * * * 
        * * * * * 
        * * * * 
        * * * 
        * * 
        *
3. *file_name*: *gmx_sorting_array.py* - Write a program that sorts a list of number in ascending order.
4. *file name*: *gmx_class.py* - Write a program that represents a Bank Account. Create a BankAccount class with a constructor that takes a account number, a balance number and obvioulsy a name.
This class will have a printing method, a payment method and an agios method. When thoses methods are called they must modify your objects attributes.
5. *file_name*: *gmx_calculus.py* - Write a program that mades calculus between two numbers. You need to handle `addition` and `multiplication` ~~Don't forget that a substraction is an additon as division is a multiplication~~
6. *file_name*: *gmx_tictactoe.py* - Write a program that allows you to play to tic tac toe versus your program.


## II. Advanced notion

1. *file_name*: *gmx_hangman.py* - Write a program that allows you to play to Hangman versus your program.
2. *file_name*: *gmx_.py* - Write a program that converts a class to a JSON file.

        class Vehicle:
            def __init__(
                self,
                name,
                engine,
                price,
                doors_number,
                color
                ):
                self.name = name
                self.engine = engine
                self.price = price
                self.doors_number = doors_number
                self.color = color

# C. End of the day

If you are here, just scream `Thank you GMX`
End of this two days formations, it's time to ask question and made a review of this day.
